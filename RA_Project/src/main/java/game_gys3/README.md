====

First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2014

====
Genre: Top Down Scrolling Shooter

Goal: The President has been captured by Dennis Rodman and his North Korean army. While a lookalike sits in to keep the public at ease, you (the billion-dollar, top secret government guinea pig) have been commissioned to rescue the President.

How to play: You have a primary gun that can be upgraded automatically if you survive. To shoot press "Z", and to move use the arrow keys. Most enemies can move in various directions and have varying weapons that shoot in varying ways.

About the levels: The different levels will have enemies of different abilities, and appearance. Each level corresponds to a different level of security of the enemy's headquarters. Every 6th level is a boss. 18 levels of increasing difficulty, will you ever find Obama?

Cheat codes: 
Press '9' to activate cheat mode for the player. You become invulnerable and capable of driving over most enemies and killing them. You also unlock all the weapons that normally take 10 stages to unlock. 
Press 'L' to jump to the first boss stage (stage 6) for testing purposes.
